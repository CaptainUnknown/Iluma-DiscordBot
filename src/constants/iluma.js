        "description": "Originally “Le Bateleur” in the Marseilles deck, this is the first proper lesson and initiation on our journey together. Consider this the base line programming that we get when we drop into this realm as a baby. Every brand-new soul comes in with basic programming that is force-fed either through school or media, the generic collective consciousness that everyone receives by default. This card represents learning and mastering all the mundane third dimensional aspects of existence in the “normal world”. The Fool has learned to navigate the sea of basic human life, and yet something feels amiss. This is the stage in which awakening can take place, the alchemical fires within him stir, he looks out into “reality” to see that not all is as he’s been told. The search for occult Truth begins to take shape within himself as he becomes increasingly jaded with the world view he was given. This is the stage when the seed activates and attempts to burst out of the confines of the it’s husk. The intelligence of the seed knows something grander is out there but cannot quite perceive what it is. The confines of this formerly protective shell while the seed was dormant now feels like a prison to the awakening consciousness craving to expand beyond it. Deep despair grows as the juxtaposition begins to become more extreme. This feeling will soon become a catalyst for growth on his journeys into the dark night of the soul..",

        "description": "The dark night of the soul commences, a journey into the watery world of illusion and discovery of Truth. Herein also, a glimmer of hope buds as we become more in tune and aware of our spiritual nature as symbolized by the lotus. We begin to learn and discover the power of our soul’s hidden wisdom that whispers to us only in the stillness of the mind and a calm beating heart. The search expands into seeking in the dark, like the seedling that has finally broken through the seed husk and must now navigate its way through the moist, dark layers of soil to get to the sun. The Fool begins to experiment from the inside with their direct effects on this sacred construct we call reality. What are the boundaries where The Fool ends and the external ‘reality’ begins? What effects can be created? What is Truth? What is no longer serving our identity of self? The Fool integrates the cognitive dissonance and masterfully dispels all that no longer stands on its own.",

The Empress represents a time where we are nurturing our spiritual side and connection to The Divine. This is our first victory and flowstate where miraculous blessings are being showered over us. Auspicious indeed, and perhaps also a bit indulgent, but The Divine smiles on her gratitude for each one of the blessings bestowed. Her faith in co-creation brings The Divine sheer bliss to watch her radiance in action. Creating the way intended, with unbridled abandon, overcoming previously unimaginable obstacles.

Spending so much time in the exquisiteness of The Divine Feminine mystery, we come into a lesson or a sort of practice phase, the opposite side of The Empress, but equivalent in nature. Now we are focused on growing our potency and power via logic and reason. The last two Major Arcana were a two-part inhale, and this card represents the beginning of the exhale. We come down off the proverbial mountain where we fasted and hid ourselves away in a cave to get closer to The Divine, and now, we rejoin society reborn with our new etheric skills we have learned. However, in this phase, we must forget them just temporarily to capitalize on the Alchemical osmotic potential. Now we can swing deeper into The Father and Emperor archetype to align with all the lessons heretofore.

We’ve integrated our mundane skills in both polarities with the spiritual skills for both masculine and feminine aspects of self. This is the perfect balance and harmony of all the skills in the Major Arcana up to this point, yet this card is slightly more masculine in nature. The Hierophant is the embodiment of a spiritually awakened man. Think of all the juicy qualities of an alpha male but tempered through a lens of the wolf who leads the pack from the rear of the pack, not out of fear and haste, but out of a harmonious respect that can only come from authentic connection to Source. Things are easy, gentle and powerful in the river of life. Careful of remaining here for too long—it is easy to get caught in this phase and lose the natural balance of Alchemical polarity. Continue the journey of The Fool to avoid stagnancy.",

At closer reflection what they are walking into is the Black sun, or the sun of the first realm, Mercury. This card represents the moment in our life when we are in total symbiosis with our inner polarities. This harmonic resonance is reflected by the grand external fractal, harmonizing the Beloved within and the Beloved without. In a more practical sense, it can absolutely symbolize a Divine Union with another, but it comes with the profound message of The Grand Beloved, fusing you into an amalgamation of its Love from every angle of your perception. You’re being offered this frequency to tap into it now. Do not reject The One whose heart only beats for your ultimate bliss. Can you find the Alchemical Union within yourself?",

This could be in the mundane sense of exerting firm boundaries to ensure your success as well as exploring the mystery of where your creative boundaries end and those of The Divine begin. This card has subtle references to card X (The Wheel of Fortune), with both the X in the image and the wheel as we begin to create momentum in our manifestations—the discovery between our impacts on creation and destiny continues. Are we indeed creating everything around us if the Grand Beloved has united with our very essence, or are we simply experiencing Karma, or Destiny? The horse-like entities are a synthesis of both the light (consciousness) and the dark (unconscious) within us, which is used as a catalyst to our goals, propelling us through equal parts unresolved ego and trauma and the taste of Divine Union, Waheguru, that came to us in card 6. Yet, the quest must go on. Can you pinpoint the boundary where you end and Creator’s creation begins? Or are you going to crawl back in your shell, overwhelmed by the illusion of “other” and protect yourself in the dark unconscious and the unformed?",

So we taper back and begin to explore the morality of desire and creation. We get in touch with the deeper values that can only be pondered when we have attained the mastery of all the cards that have come before this one. We study the morality between our choices and our desires, and perhaps decide that though we wield massive power, we refrain from using it as we desire to return to a simpler trickle of life. We don the helmet of a light warrior, connected directly to Source, yet stay in utter peace and balance through non-action, becoming stewards of this immense power, but disciplined like a highly trained Shaolin Monk, being careful not to use it out of alignment with our highest integrity in order to maintain the delicate balance of the scales of nature.",

The Hermit may have at one point represented the act of isolating oneself in remote areas, but in the higher interpretation more applicable to today’s world, it means an isolation from external influences, or rather, the generic version of reality we all are given. This is a symbolic type of isolation that breeds nonreaction, and fosters the power of thinking for oneself, not being swayed by external sources. Seeing that, at this stage in our path, we’ve already realized so much, symbolized by the double illumination, we simply cannot integrate with others that well, even from within spiritual communities at times. The solitude deepens as we turn to the only satiating thing—that of our own pure presence and communion with Creator, resting in the bosom of our awareness.",

Just as this wheel represents movement, and particularly movement with favorable connotations as influenced by Jupiter, we see the remnants of a Zodiac wheel. However, it is not the one we know of today. It is an ancient one, perhaps from distant pasts, where we have met ourselves in the same orientation on the wheel, but from either higher or lower on the cosmic horizon. This symbolizes cycles and favorable karmic implications, but each time we pass through it, we are reminded by the foreign zodiac of lessons and distant memories of times past. We have an opportunity at this junction to unite with all aspects of our soul and wisdom from ancient lifetimes. This is a moment in the journey that seems timeless, connecting both ancient past with future times.

Alluding to the feminine aspects with both symbolism of the Moon and the number 13, we could assume this horse is, in fact, a mare.

The currents are very subtle and move ever so slightly on the inner pendulum of emotion, yet at our current state of self-mastery, they cause potentially large swings in our external reality that reflect to us. As the alchemist grows, they must create spagyrics that are more and more refined as ‘less is more’ truly prevails in these settings.

The ultimate symbol for ‘As Above, So Below’ these two children do know of their connection, as they are still caught in duality, but with the light of their focus and attention, they are setting themselves on a course to transcend it. The small thin firmament that separates the two children is becoming thinner and thinner as the light of The Sun grows. And just like that, we too dissolve into Unity when the light of our awareness grows. Simultaneously, the Black Sun which represents our inner awareness rises and supersedes all external false idols, and we soon come to be consumed by the all-pervading force of this Clear Light of the Void. A moment of peace engulfs us as we still the two minds and bring them into the harmonic resonance of unity.",

Judgment comes swiftly, and “Ayni” or right relationship, must proceed. The Fool is offered a final opportunity to course correct nearly immediately in only such a way that Truth and love can guide, for he’s reached the heights of anointed illumination and the internal alchemical marriage. Now it is a sacred duty to make a judgment on oneself. With this comes the opportunity for responsibility for our creation. What will we choose? Will we take the Melchizedek vow and be of service till every aspect of our creation meets the light of the highest Truth and willingly joins The One? Will we dissolve into the abyss of unbridled bliss from whence we came—Waheguru—once more? The choice is ok whether to stay and be of service or to dissolve back into The Divine.

        "description": "The first and last card of the Tarot, this card represents the querent or you. Well, all of us really. It is a reminder to zoom out dimensionally to access all the levels of our being.  When The Fool makes his way through the lessons, initiations, tests and victories of the Major Arcana, he finally reaches his fullest attainment, enlightenment/Mt.Meru/Agartha/Polaris etc. This comes in the form of Union with the Grandest Beloved(God).  From there, once he has achieved this mastery, he may choose to forget everything he ever knew and start the journey at the beginning level to play the Game of Life once again, or he can maintain his mastery and life in the world while being clearly not of it. The entire world views him as a fool, either being the master perceived as mad by the sleeping masses, or a brand-new soul: asleep in the game, a new fractal of Creator waiting to be programmed.  Either way, he is a fool, carefree and jolly, silly and ravenously mad to the outside world.  The Fool reminds us to view every soul as a master, no matter how sleepy or sheepy they may seem, even if they are following mindlessly in the humdrum of the collective hypnosis. We may not know what they have already achieved or if they have chosen to forget it all and play the game again. We must trust people even when they make decisions that we believe are silly. We must honor each person’s self-possession and mastery, even when we don’t understand it.  This card encourages us to get a bird’s eye perspective (dimensionally speaking) and to realize not everyone nor everything is as it seems.  Honor the divinity within all. Embrace the Mystery.  We do not yet know all. ",
